How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code is functional and secure by completeing tests with the different sections of the program seperately and making sure I'm following the requirements of the project. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret the users needs by making sure they are still thought of during the design and quality assurance brainstorming because meeting their needs and the clients needs are what determines the success of the projection. Some of the acceptance testing is put in place to determine if at the end the intended user is satisfied and the goal is met.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software formatting my code as an outline of the requirements that the company or client provides me, I then expand on that. Being open to feedback and possible corrections is always a plus when designing software.
